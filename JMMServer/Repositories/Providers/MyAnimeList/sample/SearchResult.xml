    <synopsis>
      Sousuke Sagara, a seventeen year old military specialist working for the secret organization MITHRIL, has been assigned to protect the latest &amp;quot;Whispered&amp;quot; candidate Kaname Chidori. To complete this task Sousuke will have to deal with enemies from his past as well as the occasional panty thief. Unfortunately for Sousuke, the toughest part of his mission isn&amp;#039;t only protecting Miss Chidori but also getting used to living an average High School students life, no easy task for someone raised on the battlefield.&lt;br /&gt;

      It&amp;#039;s back-to-school mayhem with Kaname Chidori and her war-freak classmate Sousuke Sagara as they encounter more misadventures in and out of Jindai High School. But when Kaname gets into some serious trouble, Sousuke takes the guise of Bonta-kun - the gun-wielding, butt-kicking mascot. And while he struggles to continue living as a normal teenager, Sousuke also has to deal with protecting his superior officer Teletha Testarossa, who has decided to take a vacation from Mithril and spend a couple of weeks as his and Kaname&amp;#039;s classmate.&lt;br /&gt;

      This series is set about two months after the events ocurred in the Tuatha de Danaan at the end of the original series. Mithril becomes aware of a secret organization that has technology able to counter the ECS (Electronic Cloaking System) mode. This organization, known as Amalgam, also has &amp;quot;Black Technology&amp;quot;, obtained from &amp;quot;Whispered&amp;quot; like Kaname Chidori, and like the other intelligency agencies, they intend to obtain more. However, when Sousuke&amp;#039;s mission to protect Chidori is terminated by Mithril, all seems to be in place for Amalgam&amp;#039;s plans... Like many of its fans know, it is based of the FMP novel &amp;quot;The End of Day by Day.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;

    <synopsis>The rules of alchemy state that to gain something, one must lose something of equal value. Alchemy is the process of taking apart and reconstructing an object into a different entity, with the rules of alchemy to govern this procedure. However, there exists an object that can bring any alchemist above these rules, the object known as the Philosopher&amp;#039;s Stone. The young Edward Elric is a particularly talented alchemist who through an accident years back lost his younger brother Alphonse and one of his legs. Sacrificing one of his arms as well, he used alchemy to bind his brother&amp;#039;s soul to a suit of armor. This lead to the beginning of their journey to restore their bodies, in search for the legendary Philosopher&amp;#039;s Stone.</synopsis>

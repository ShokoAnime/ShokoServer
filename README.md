# What is Shoko Server
Shoko makes managing your anime collection effortless. It ensures that your collection is well-organized, accessible,
and easy to navigate. Regardless of whether you have a small or large anime collection, Shoko can handle it. Thanks to
its scalability, it can grow alongside your collection with ease.

With Shoko, you'll have access to your entire collection both locally and over the internet, with no additional work
required outside the initial configuration of Shoko Server and one of the supported media player plugins. Say 
goodbye to manually inputting information or renaming your files to a specific format just to obtain basic series 
data - with Shoko, this is a thing of the past.

Shoko takes the hassle out of managing your anime collection. With its user-friendly interface, you can sit
back and let it do the work for you. No more manual inputting or renaming - just effortless organization and access to
your favorite anime.

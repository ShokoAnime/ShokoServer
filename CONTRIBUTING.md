# Contributing to JMM

Contributing to JMM is simple! 

Anyone can contribute by simply Forking the project and submitting a Pull Request with your changes. Here are some things to consider before submitting your pull request and once you’ve submitted it. 
* Thoroughly test any changes you make to reduce the chance of breaking another function. Multiple commits in a pull request is ok. 
* Please update your pull request with each commit you submit; it makes it easier for us to understand. 
* Some pull requests might remain open for a number of days, this can be for a number of reasons so we’ll make sure to keep you updated on why. 

# Reporting Issues

First off, make sure the issue you are reporting is about JMM Server, not JMM Desktop. It's easy to confuse the two when it comes to functionality. JMM Server handles the majority of functions even if the setting is available in JMM Desktop.  

Here are some examples: 

* Want to see a new feature added? Most likely JMM Server related.
* Problems with hashing? JMM Server related. 
* Connecting to MAL or Trakt? JMM Server related.
* Image download problems? JMM Server related.
* Series/Group names incorrect? JMM Server related.
* Change how many images are downloaded? JMM Desktop related. 

Hopefully these examples help point you in the right direction. Also please make sure your report contains all the information we'll need to replicate the issue. 

We encourage everyone to join us on Discord if they have any questions, need support or require further explanation.
